Upgrade Instructions
====================
Trac environments sometimes need to be upgraded before they can be used 
in a new version of Trac. This document describes the steps necessary
to upgrade an environment.

From 0.8.x to 0.9
-----------------

The database schema was changed between 0.8.x and 0.9. Existing environments
must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.9.
The following command will perform the upgrade:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv upgrade

Trac environments are created with a default set of wiki pages. It's 
recommended to update these pages on existing environments whenever
Trac is upgraded to get up-to-date documentation and additional functionality.
The following command will perform the update:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv wiki upgrade

If you're using mod_python, you will need to change the name of the mod_python 
handler in the Apache HTTPD configuration:

   from: PythonHandler trac.ModPythonHandler
   to:   PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend


From 0.7.x to 0.8
-----------------
The database schema was changed between 0.7.x and 0.8. Existing environments
must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.8.
The following command will perform the upgrade:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv upgrade

Trac environments are created with a default set of wiki pages. It's 
recommended to update these pages on existing environments whenever
Trac is upgraded to get up-to-date documentation and additional functionality.
The following command will perform the update:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv wiki upgrade

0.8 adds a new roadmap feature which requires additional permissions. While a
fresh installation will by default grant ROADMAP_VIEW and MILESTONE_VIEW
permissions to anonymous, these permissions have to be granted manually when
upgrading:

  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv permission add anonymous MILESTONE_VIEW
  trac-admin /path/to/projectenv permission add anonymous ROADMAP_VIEW


from 0.6.x to 0.7
-----------------
Trac 0.7 has a new database format, requiring manual upgrade.

Previous versions of Trac stored wiki pages, ticket, reports,
settings, etc. in a single SQLite database file. Trac 0.7 replaces this file
with a new backend storage format; the 'Trac Environment', which is a
directory containing an SQLite database, a human-readable configuration file,
log-files and attachments.

Fear not though, old-style Trac databases can easily be converted to
Environments using the included "tracdb2env" program as follows:

  tracdb2env /path/to/old/project.db /path/to/new/projectenv

tracdb2env will create a new environment and copy the information from
the old database to the new environment. The existing database will
not be modified.

You also need to update your apache configuration:
change this line:

   SetEnv TRAC_DB "/path/to/old/project.db"

to:

   SetEnv TRAC_ENV "/path/to/new/projectenv"


Updating wiki pages
-------------------
There are a set of default wiki pages included in the install,
automatically imported upon creating a new environment with the 
'trac-admin initenv' command.

If you wish to update these pages on an already existing [older] Trac 
environment, you can import the pages manually using trac-admin:
   
 trac-admin /path/to/myprojectenv wiki upgrade

Please note that you have to repeat this step for each Trac environment
you wish to upgrade.
