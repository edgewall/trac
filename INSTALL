Trac Installation Guide for 1.0
===============================

Trac is written in the Python programming language and needs a
database, `SQLite`_, `PostgreSQL`_, or `MySQL`_. For HTML rendering,
Trac uses the `Genshi`_ templating system.

Since version 0.12, Trac can also be localized, and there is probably
a translation available in your language. If you want to use the Trac
interface in other languages, then make sure you have installed the
optional package `Babel`_. Pay attention to the extra steps for
localization support in the `Installing Trac`_ section below. Lacking
Babel, you will only get the default English version.

If you're interested in contributing new translations for other
languages or enhancing the existing translations, then please have a
look at `TracL10N`_.

What follows are generic instructions for installing and setting up
Trac. While you may find instructions for installing Trac on specific
systems at `TracInstallPlatforms`_ on the main Trac site, please first
read through these general instructions to get a good understanding of
the tasks involved.


Dependencies
------------


Mandatory Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Trac, the following software packages must be installed:


+ `Python`_, version >= 2.5 and < 3.0 (note that we dropped the
  support for Python 2.4 in this release)
+ `setuptools`_, version >= 0.6
+ `Genshi*`_, version >= 0.6


You also need a database system and the corresponding python bindings.
The database can be either SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL.


For the SQLite database
```````````````````````

As you must be using Python 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7, you already have the
SQLite database bindings bundled with the standard distribution of
Python: the sqlite3 module.

Optionally, you may install a newer version of `pysqlite`_ than the
one provided by the Python distribution. See `PySqlite*`_ for details.


For the PostgreSQL database
```````````````````````````

You need to install the database and its Python bindings:


+ `PostgreSQL`_, version 8.0 or later
+ `psycopg2`_, version 2.0 or later


See `DatabaseBackend`_ for details.


For the MySQL database
``````````````````````

Trac works well with MySQL, provided you follow the guidelines:


+ `MySQL`_ or `MariaDB`_, version 5.0 or later
+ `MySQLdb`_, version 1.2.2 or later


Given the caveats and known issues surrounding MySQL, read the
`MySqlDb*`_ page before creating the database.


Optional Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Version Control System
``````````````````````


Subversion
++++++++++


+ `Subversion`_, 1.5.x or later and the corresponding Python bindings.
  Older versions starting from 1.0, like 1.2.4, 1.3.2 or 1.4.2, etc. may
  still work. For troubleshooting information, check the
  `TracSubversion`_ page.


There are `pre-compiled SWIG bindings`_ available for various
platforms. (Good luck finding precompiled SWIG bindings for any
Windows package at that listing. `TracSubversion*`_ points you to
`Alagazam`_, which works for me under Python 2.6.)

Note that Trac doesn't use `PySVN`_, neither does it work yet with the
newer ctype -style bindings.

Note: if using Subversion, Trac must be installed on the same machine
. Remote repositories are currently `not supported`_.


Git
+++


+ `Git`_ 1.5.6 or later.


More information is available on the `TracGit`_ page.


Others
++++++

Support for other version control systems is provided via third-
parties. See `PluginList#VersionControlSystems`_ and
`VersionControlSystem`_.


Web Server
``````````

A web server is optional because Trac has a server included, see the
`Running the Standalone Server`_ section below.

Alternatively you can configure Trac to run in any of the following
environments:


+ `Apache`_ with

    + `mod_wsgi`_, see `TracModWSGI`_ and
      `http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithTrac`_
    + `mod_python 3.5.0`_, see `TracModPython`_

+ a `FastCGI`_-capable web server (see `TracFastCgi`_)
+ an `AJP`_-capable web server (see `TracOnWindowsIisAjp`_)
+ a FastCGI and FastCGI-to-WSGI gateway (see
  `TracOnWindowsIisWfastcgi`_)
+ a CGI-capable web server (see `TracCgi`_), but *usage of Trac as a
  cgi script is highly discouraged*, better use one of the previous
  options.


Other Python Packages
`````````````````````


+ `Babel*`_, version 0.9.5, 0.9.6 or >= 1.3 needed for localization
  support
+ `docutils`_, version >= 0.3.9 for `WikiRestructuredText`_.
+ `Pygments`_ for `syntax highlighting`_.`SilverCity`_ and/or
  `Enscript`_ may still be used but are deprecated and you really should
  be using Pygments.
+ `pytz`_ to get a complete list of time zones, otherwise Trac will
  fall back on a shorter list from an internal time zone implementation.


Attention : The available versions of these dependencies are not
necessarily interchangeable, so please pay attention to the version
numbers. If you are having trouble getting Trac to work, please
double-check all the dependencies before asking for help on the
`MailingList`_ or `IrcChannel`_.

Please refer to the documentation of these packages to find out how
they are best installed. In addition, most of the `platform-specific
instructions`_ also describe the installation of the dependencies.
Keep in mind however that the information there probably concern older
versions of Trac than the one you're installing.


Installing Trac
---------------

The `trac-admin`_ command-line tool, used to create and maintain
`project environments`_, as well as the `tracd`_ standalone server are
installed along with Trac. There are several methods for installing
Trac.

It is assumed throughout this guide that you have elevated permissions
as the root user, or by prefixing commands with sudo . The umask 0022
should be used for a typical installation on a Unix-based platform.


Using easy_install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac can be installed from `PyPI`_ or the Subversion repository using
`setuptools`_.

A few command-line examples:


+ Install the latest stable version of Trac:

::

    $ easy_install Trac


+ Install latest development version:

::

    $ easy_install http://download.edgewall.org/trac/Trac-latest-dev.tar.gz

  Note that in this case you won't have the possibility to run a
  localized version of Trac; either use a released version or install
  from source.


More information can be found on the `setuptools*`_ page.

Setuptools Warning: If the version of your setuptools is in the range
5.4 through 5.6, the environment variable
PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS must be set in order to avoid
significant performance degradation. More information may be found in
`Deploying Trac`_.


Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

'pip' is an easy_install replacement that is very useful to quickly
install Python packages. To get a Trac installation up and running in
less than 5 minutes:

Assuming you want to have your entire pip installation in
/opt/user/trac :


  +

::

    $ pip install trac psycopg2 


or:


  +

::

    $ pip install trac mysql-python 


Make sure your OS specific headers are available for pip to
automatically build PostgreSQL ( libpq-dev ) or MySQL (
libmysqlclient-dev ) bindings.

pip will automatically resolve all dependencies (like Genshi,
pygments, etc.), download the latest packages from pypi.python.org and
create a self contained installation in /opt/user/trac .

All commands ( tracd , trac-admin ) are available in
/opt/user/trac/bin . This can also be leveraged for mod_python (using
PythonHandler directive) and mod_wsgi (using WSGIDaemonProcess
directive).

Additionally, you can install several Trac plugins (listed `here`_)
through pip.


From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the python-typical setup at the top of the source directory also
works. You can obtain the source for a .tar.gz or .zip file
corresponding to a release (e.g. Trac-1.0.tar.gz ) from the
`TracDownload`_ page, or you can get the source directly from the
repository. See `TracRepositories`_ for details.


::

    $ python ./setup.py install


You will need root permissions or equivalent for this step.

This will byte-compile the Python source code and install it as an
.egg file or folder in the site-packages directory of your Python
installation. The .egg will also contain all other resources needed by
standard Trac, such as htdocs and templates .

If you install from source and want to make Trac available in other
languages, make sure Babel is installed. Only then, perform the
install (or simply redo the install once again afterwards if you
realize Babel was not yet installed):


::

    $ python ./setup.py install


Alternatively, you can run bdist_egg and copy the .egg from dist/ to
the place of your choice, or you can create a Windows installer (
bdist_wininst ).


Using installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows Trac can be installed using the exe installers available on
the `TracDownload`_ page. Installers are available for the 32 and 64
bit versions of Python. Make sure to use the installer that matches
the architecture of your Python installation.


Using package manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac may be available in the package repository for your platform.
Note however, that the version provided by the package manager may not
be the latest release.


Advanced easy_install Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Trac to a custom location, or find out about other advanced
installation options, run:


::

    $ easy_install --help


Also see `Installing Python Modules`_ for detailed information.

Specifically, you might be interested in:


::

    $ easy_install --prefix=/path/to/installdir


or, if installing Trac on a Mac OS X system:


::

    $ easy_install --prefix=/usr/local --install-dir=/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages


Note : If installing on Mac OS X 10.6 running easy_install
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/trunk will install into /usr/local
and /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages by default.

The above will place your tracd and trac-admin commands into
/usr/local/bin and will install the Trac libraries and dependencies
into /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages , which is Apple's preferred
location for third-party Python application installations.


Creating a Project Environment
------------------------------

A `Trac environment`_ is the backend where Trac stores information
like wiki pages, tickets, reports, settings, etc. An environment is
basically a directory that contains a human-readable `configuration
file`_, and other files and directories.

A new environment is created using `trac-admin`_:


::

    $ trac-admin /path/to/myproject initenv


`trac-admin`_ will prompt you for the information it needs to create
the environment, such as the name of the project and the `database
connection string`_. If you're not sure what to specify for one of
these options, just press <Enter> to use the default value.

Using the default database connection string in particular will always
work as long as you have SQLite installed. For the other `database
backends`_ you should plan ahead and already have a database ready to
use at this point.

Since 0.12, Trac doesn't ask for a `source code repository`_ anymore
when creating an environment. Repositories can be `added`_ afterwards,
and support for specific version control systems is disabled by
default.

Also note that the values you specify here can be changed later by
directly editing the `conf/trac.ini`_ configuration file.

Filesystem Warning: When selecting the location of your environment,
make sure that the filesystem on which the environment directory
resides supports sub-second timestamps (i.e. not ext2 or ext3 on
Linux, or HFS+ on OSX), as the modification time of the conf/trac.ini
file will be monitored to decide whether an environment restart is
needed or not. A too coarse-grained timestamp resolution may result in
inconsistencies in Trac < 1.0.2. The best advice is to opt for a
platform with sub-second timestamp resolution, regardless of the Trac
version.

Finally, make sure the user account under which the web front-end runs
will have write permissions to the environment directory and all the
files inside. This will be the case if you run trac-admin ... initenv
as this user. If not, you should set the correct user afterwards. For
example on Linux, with the web server running as user apache and group
apache , enter:


::

    $ chown -R apache.apache /path/to/myproject


The actual username and groupname of the Apache server may not be
exactly apache , and are specified in the Apache configuration file by
the directives User and Group (if Apache httpd is what you use).

Warning: Please only use ASCII-characters for account name and project
path, unicode characters are not supported there.


Deploying Trac
--------------

Setuptools Warning: If the version of your setuptools is in the range
5.4 through 5.6, the environment variable
PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS must be set in order to avoid
significant performance degradation.

If running tracd , the environment variable can be set system-wide or
for just the user that runs the tracd process. There are several ways
to accomplish this in addition to what is discussed here, and
depending on the distribution of your OS.

To be effective system-wide a shell script with the export statement
may be added to /etc/profile.d . To be effective for a user session
the export statement may be added to ~/.profile .


::

    export PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS=1


Alternatively, the variable can be set in the shell before executing
tracd :


::

    $ PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS=1 tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject


If running the Apache web server, Ubuntu/Debian users should add the
export statement to /etc/apache2/envvars . RedHat/CentOS/Fedora should
can add the export statement to /etc/sysconfig/httpd .


Running the Standalone Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After having created a Trac environment, you can easily try the web
interface by running the standalone server `tracd`_:


::

    $ tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject


Then, fire up a browser and visit http://localhost:8000/ . You should
get a simple listing of all environments that tracd knows about.
Follow the link to the environment you just created, and you should
see Trac in action. If you only plan on managing a single project with
Trac you can have the standalone server skip the environment list by
starting it like this:


::

    $ tracd -s --port 8000 /path/to/myproject


Running Trac on a Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac provides various options for connecting to a "real" web server:


+ `FastCGI*`_
+ `Apache with mod_wsgi`_
+ `Apache with mod_python`_
+ *`CGI`_: should not be used, as it degrades performance*


Trac also supports `AJP*`_ which may be your choice if you want to
connect to IIS. Other deployment scenarios are possible: `nginx`_,
`uwsgi`_, `Isapi-wsgi`_ etc.


Generating the Trac cgi-bin directory
`````````````````````````````````````

In order for Trac to function properly with FastCGI you need to have a
trac.fcgi file and for mod_wsgi a trac.wsgi file. These are Python
scripts which load the appropriate Python code. They can be generated
using the deploy option of `trac-admin`_.

There is, however, a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. The `trac-
admin`_ command requires an existing environment to function, but
complains if the deploy directory already exists. This is a problem,
because environments are often stored in a subdirectory of the deploy.
The solution is to do something like this:


::

    $ mkdir -p /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project
    $ trac-admin /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project initenv
    $ trac-admin /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project deploy /tmp/deploy
    $ mv /tmp/deploy/* /usr/share/trac


Don't forget to check that the web server has the execution right on
scripts in the /usr/share/trac/cgi-bin directory.


Mapping Static Resources
````````````````````````

Without additional configuration, Trac will handle requests for static
resources such as stylesheets and images. For anything other than a
`TracStandalone`_ deployment, this is not optimal as the web server
can be set up to directly serve the static resources. For CGI setup,
this is highly undesirable as it causes abysmal performance.

Web servers such as `Apache`_ allow you to create *Aliases* to
resources, giving them a virtual URL that doesn't necessarily reflect
their location on the file system. We can map requests for static
resources directly to directories on the file system, to avoid Trac
processing the requests.

There are two primary URL paths for static resources: /chrome/common
and /chrome/site . Plugins can add their own resources, usually
accessible at the /chrome/<plugin> path.

A single /chrome alias can used if the static resources are extracted
for all plugins. This means that the deploy command must be executed
after installing or updating a plugin that provides static resources,
or after modifying resources in the $env/htdocs directory. This is
probably appropriate for most installations but may not be what you
want if, for example, you wish to upload plugins through the *Plugins*
administration page.

The resources are extracted using the `trac-admin`_ <environment>
deploy command:

::

    deploy <directory>
    
        Extract static resources from Trac and all plugins
    


The target <directory> will contain an htdocs directory with:


+ common/ - the static resources of Trac
+ site/ - a copy of the environment's htdocs/ directory
+ shared - the static resources shared by multiple Trac environments,
  with a location defined by the [inherit] htdocs_dir option
+ <plugin>/ - one directory for each resource directory provided by
  the plugins enabled for this environment


The example that follows will create a single /chrome alias. If that
isn't the correct approach for your installation you simply need to
create more specific aliases:


::

    Alias /trac/chrome/common /path/to/trac/htdocs/common
    Alias /trac/chrome/site /path/to/trac/htdocs/site
    Alias /trac/chrome/shared /path/to/trac/htdocs/shared
    Alias /trac/chrome/<plugin> /path/to/trac/htdocs/<plugin>


Example: Apache and ScriptAlias
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming the deployment has been done this way:


::

    $ trac-admin /var/trac/env deploy /path/to/shared/trac


Add the following snippet to Apache configuration, changing paths to
match your deployment. The snippet must be placed *before* the
ScriptAlias or WSGIScriptAlias directive, because those directives map
all requests to the Trac application:


::

    Alias /trac/chrome /path/to/trac/htdocs
    
    <Directory "/path/to/www/trac/htdocs">
      # For Apache 2.2
      <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
      </IfModule>
      # For Apache 2.4
      <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
        Require all granted
      </IfModule>
    </Directory>


If using mod_python, add this too, otherwise the alias will be
ignored:


::

    <Location "/trac/chrome/common">
      SetHandler None
    </Location>


Alternatively, if you wish to serve static resources directly from
your project's htdocs directory rather than the location to which the
files are extracted with the deploy command, you can configure Apache
to serve those resources. Again, put this *before* the ScriptAlias or
WSGIScriptAlias for the .*cgi scripts, and adjust names and locations
to match your installation:


::

    Alias /trac/chrome/site /path/to/projectenv/htdocs
    
    <Directory "/path/to/projectenv/htdocs">
      # For Apache 2.2
      <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
      </IfModule>
      # For Apache 2.4
      <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
        Require all granted
      </IfModule>
    </Directory>


Another alternative to aliasing /trac/chrome/common is having Trac
generate direct links for those static resources (and only those),
using the ` [trac] htdocs_location`_ configuration setting:


::

    [trac]
    htdocs_location = http://static.example.org/trac-common/


Note that this makes it easy to have a dedicated domain serve those
static resources, preferentially cookie-less.

Of course, you still need to make the Trac htdocs/common directory
available through the web server at the specified URL, for example by
copying (or linking) the directory into the document root of the web
server:


::

    $ ln -s /path/to/trac/htdocs/common /var/www/static.example.org/trac-common


Setting up the Plugin Cache
```````````````````````````

Some Python plugins need to be extracted to a cache directory. By
default the cache resides in the home directory of the current user.
When running Trac on a Web Server as a dedicated user (which is highly
recommended) who has no home directory, this might prevent the plugins
from starting. To override the cache location you can set the
PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable. Refer to your server
documentation for detailed instructions on how to set environment
variables.


Configuring Authentication
--------------------------

Trac uses HTTP authentication. You'll need to configure your webserver
to request authentication when the .../login URL is hit (the virtual
path of the "login" button). Trac will automatically pick the
REMOTE_USER variable up after you provide your credentials. Therefore,
all user management goes through your web server configuration. Please
consult the documentation of your web server for more info.

The process of adding, removing, and configuring user accounts for
authentication depends on the specific way you run Trac.

Please refer to one of the following sections:


+ `TracStandalone#UsingAuthentication`_ if you use the standalone
  server, tracd .
+ `TracModWSGI#ConfiguringAuthentication`_ if you use the Apache web
  server, with any of its front end: mod_wsgi of course, but the same
  instructions applies also for mod_python , mod_fcgi or mod_fastcgi .
+ `TracFastCgi`_ if you are using another web server with FCGI
  support, such as Cherokee, Lighttpd, LiteSpeed, nginx.


The following document also contains some useful information for
beginners: `TracAuthenticationIntroduction`_.


Granting admin rights to the admin user
---------------------------------------

Grant admin rights to user admin:


::

    $ trac-admin /path/to/myproject permission add admin TRAC_ADMIN


This user will have an "Admin" entry menu that will allow you to
administrate your Trac project.


Finishing the install
---------------------


Enable version control components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for version control systems is provided by optional components
in Trac and the components are disabled by default *(since 1.0)*.
Subversion and Git must be explicitly enabled if you wish to use them.
See `TracRepositoryAdmin`_ for more details.

The version control systems are enabled by adding the following to the
[components] section of your `trac.ini`_, or enabling the components
in the "Plugins" admin panel:


::

    [components]
    tracopt.versioncontrol.svn.* = enabled


::

    [components]
    tracopt.versioncontrol.git.* = enabled


After enabling the components, repositories can be configured through
the *Repositories* admin panel or by editing `trac.ini*`_. Automatic
changeset references can be inserted as ticket comments by configuring
`CommitTicketUpdater`_.


Using Trac
~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your Trac site up and running, you should be able to
create tickets, view the timeline, browse your version control
repository if configured, etc.

Keep in mind that *anonymous* (not logged in) users can by default
access only a few of the features, in particular they will have a
read-only access to the resources. You will need to configure
authentication and grant additional `permissions`_ to authenticated
users to see the full set of features.

*Enjoy!*
