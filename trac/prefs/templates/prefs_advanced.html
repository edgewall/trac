              The session key is used to identify stored custom
              settings and session data on the server. Although it is
              automatically generated by default, you may change it to
              something easier to remember at any time if you wish to
              load your settings in a different web browser.

              You may load a previously created session by entering
              the corresponding session key below. This lets you share
              settings between multiple computers and web browsers.
