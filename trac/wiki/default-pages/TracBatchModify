[[TracGuideToc]]

From [wiki:TracQuery custom query] results Trac provides support for modifying a batch of tickets in one request.

To perform a batch modification select the tickets you wish to modify and set the new field values using the section underneath the query results. 

== Configuration ==

You can configure how text fields are treated. with the following options. These are also the default values.

{{{
[batchmod]

# Which text fields are treated as lists. This means that new values will
# be merged into or removed from the field appropriately. For example,
# given a keywords field with the values 'report', adding the value
# 'component' will result in 'report,component'. You can also remove
# values by prepending them with '-'. In the example above using '-report'
# would have removed 'report' from the list.
fields_as_list = keywords

# The separator for values passed to the list. By default the separator is
# a comma or any whitespace character.
list_separator_regex = [,\s]+

# The string used to connect list values after they are merged together.  
list_connector_string = ,

== Limitations ==
