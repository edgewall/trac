= !CamelCase =
New words created by smashing together capitalized words.

CamelCase is the original wiki convention for creating hyperlinks, with the additional requirement that the capitals are followed by a lower-case letter; hence “AlabamA” and “ABc” will not be links.

== Customizing the Wiki behavior ==

Some people dislike linking by CamelCase.  While Trac remains faithful to the original Wiki style, it provides a number of ways to accomodate users with different preferences:
 * There's an option (`ignore_missing_pages` in the [wiki:TracIni#wiki-section "[wiki]"] section of TracIni) to simply ignore links to missing pages when the link is written using the CamelCase style, instead of that word being replaced by a gray link followed by a question mark.[[BR]]
   That can be useful when CamelCase style is used to name code artifacts like class names and there's no corresponding page for them.
 * There's an option (`split_page_names` in the  [wiki:TracIni#wiki-section "[wiki]"] section of TracIni) to automatically insert space characters between the words of a CamelCase link when rendering the link.
 * Creation of explicit Wiki links is also easy, see WikiPageNames for details.
 * In addition, Wiki formatting can be disabled completely in some places (e.g. when rendering commit log messages). See `wiki_format_messages` in the [wiki:TracIni#changeset-section "[changeset]"] section of TracIni.

See TracIni for more information on the available options.
