= Fine grained permissions
[[PageOutline(2-5, Contents, floated)]]
[[TracGuideToc]]

There is a general mechanism in place that allows custom **permission policies** to grant or deny any action on any Trac resource, or even specific versions of a resource.

That mechanism is `authz_policy`, which is an optional module in `tracopt.perm.authz_policy.*`, so it is installed by default. It can be activated via the //Plugins// panel in the Trac administration module.

== Permission Policies

A great diversity of permission policies can be implemented and Trac comes with a few examples. 

The active policies are determined by a [TracIni#trac-permission_policies-option configuration setting]:

{{{#!ini
[trac]
permission_policies = ReadonlyWikiPolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy
}}}

* [#ReadonlyWikiPolicy] controls readonly access to wiki pages.
* !DefaultPermissionPolicy checks for the traditional coarse-grained permissions described in TracPermissions.
* !LegacyAttachmentPolicy uses the coarse-grained permissions to check permissions on attachments.

Among the optional choices, there is [#AuthzPolicy], a very generic permission policy, based on an Authz-style system. See
[trac:source:branches/1.2-stable/tracopt/perm/authz_policy.py authz_policy.py] for details. 

Another permission policy [#AuthzSourcePolicy], uses the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html path-based authorization] defined by Subversion to enforce permissions on the version control system.

See also [trac:source:branches/1.2-stable/sample-plugins/permissions sample-plugins/permissions] for more examples.

=== !AuthzPolicy
==== Configuration
* Put a [http://swapoff.org/files/authzpolicy.conf conf] file in a secure location on the server, not readable by users other than the webuser. If the  file contains non-ASCII characters, the UTF-8 encoding should be used.
* Update your `trac.ini`:
  1. modify the [TracIni#trac-section permission_policies] entry in the `[trac]` section:
{{{#!ini
[trac]
permission_policies = AuthzPolicy, ReadonlyWikiPolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy
}}}
  1. add a new `[authz_policy]` section and point the `authz_file` option to the conf file:
{{{#!ini
[authz_policy]
authz_file = /some/trac/env/conf/authzpolicy.conf
}}}
  1. enable the plugin through [/admin/general/plugin WebAdmin] or by editing the `[components]` section:
{{{#!ini
[components]
tracopt.perm.authz_policy.* = enabled
}}}

==== Usage Notes

Note the order in which permission policies are specified: policies are implemented in the sequence provided and therefore may override earlier policy specifications.

A policy will return either `True`, `False` or `None` for a given permission check. `True` is returned if the policy explicitly grants the permission. `False` is returned if the policy explicitly denies the permission. `None` is returned if the policy is unable to either grant or deny the permission.

NOTE: Only if the return value is `None` will the ''next'' permission policy be consulted. If none of the policies explicitly grants the permission, the final result will be `False`, i.e. permission denied.

The `authzpolicy.conf` file is a `.ini` style configuration file:
{{{#!ini
[wiki:PrivatePage@*]
john = WIKI_VIEW, !WIKI_MODIFY
jack = WIKI_VIEW
* =
}}}
* Each section of the config is a glob pattern used to match against a Trac resource descriptor. These descriptors are in the form:
{{{
<realm>:<id>@<version>[/<realm>:<id>@<version> ...]
}}}

Resources are ordered left to right, from parent to child. If any component is inapplicable, `*` is substituted. If the version pattern is not specified explicitly, all versions (`@*`) is added implicitly. Example: Match the WikiStart page:
{{{#!ini
[wiki:*]
[wiki:WikiStart*]
[wiki:WikiStart@*]
[wiki:WikiStart]
}}}

Example: Match the attachment `wiki:WikiStart@117/attachment:FOO.JPG@*` on WikiStart:
{{{#!ini
[wiki:*]
[wiki:WikiStart*]
[wiki:WikiStart@*]
[wiki:WikiStart@*/attachment:*]
[wiki:WikiStart@117/attachment:FOO.JPG]
}}}

* Sections are checked against the current Trac resource descriptor '''IN ORDER''' of appearance in the configuration file. '''ORDER IS CRITICAL'''.

* Once a section matches, the current username is matched against the keys (usernames) of the section, '''IN ORDER'''. 
  * If a key (username) is prefixed with a `@`, it is treated as a group. 
  * If a value (permission) is prefixed with a `!`, the permission is denied rather than granted.

The username will match any of 'anonymous', 'authenticated', <username> or '*', using normal Trac permission rules. || '''Note:''' Other groups which are created by user (e.g. by 'adding subjects to groups' on web interface page //Admin / Permissions//) cannot be used. See [trac:ticket:5648 #5648] for details about this missing feature. ||

For example, if the `authz_file` contains:
{{{#!ini
[wiki:WikiStart@*]
* = WIKI_VIEW

[wiki:PrivatePage@*]
john = WIKI_VIEW
* = !WIKI_VIEW
}}}
and the default permissions are set like this:
{{{
john           WIKI_VIEW
jack           WIKI_VIEW
# anonymous has no WIKI_VIEW
}}}

Then: 
  * All versions of WikiStart will be viewable by everybody, including anonymous
  * !PrivatePage will be viewable only by john
  * other pages will be viewable only by john and jack

Groups:
{{{#!ini
[groups]
admins = john, jack
devs = alice, bob

[wiki:Dev@*]
@admins = TRAC_ADMIN
@devs = WIKI_VIEW
* =

[*]
@admins = TRAC_ADMIN
* =
}}}

Then:
- everything is blocked (whitelist approach), but
- admins get all TRAC_ADMIN everywhere and
- devs can view wiki pages.

Some repository examples (Browse Source specific):
{{{#!ini
# A single repository:
[repository:test_repo@*]
john = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW
# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW for the entire test_repo

# The default repository (requires Trac 1.0.2 or later):
[repository:@*]
john = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW
# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW for the entire default repository

# All repositories:
[repository:*@*]
jack = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW
# Jack has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW for all repositories
}}}

Very granular repository access:
{{{#!ini
# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to trunk/src/some/location/ only
[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/*@*]
john = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW

# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to only revision 1 of all files at trunk/src/some/location only
[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/*@1]
john = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW

# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to all revisions of 'somefile' at trunk/src/some/location only 
[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/somefile@*]
john = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW

# John has BROWSER_VIEW and FILE_VIEW access to only revision 1 of 'somefile' at trunk/src/some/location only
[repository:test_repo@*/source:trunk/src/some/location/somefile@1]
john = BROWSER_VIEW, FILE_VIEW
}}}

Note: In order for Timeline to work/visible for John, we must add CHANGESET_VIEW to the above permission list.

==== Missing Features
Although possible with the !DefaultPermissionPolicy handling (see Admin panel), fine-grained permissions still miss those grouping features (see [trac:ticket:9573 #9573], [trac:ticket:5648 #5648]). Patches are partially available, see authz_policy.2.patch, part of [trac:ticket:6680 #6680].

You cannot do the following:
{{{#!ini
[groups]
team1 = a, b, c
team2 = d, e, f
team3 = g, h, i
departmentA = team1, team2
}}}

Permission groups are not supported either, so you cannot do the following:
{{{#!ini
[groups]
permission_level_1 = WIKI_VIEW, TICKET_VIEW
permission_level_2  = permission_level_1, WIKI_MODIFY, TICKET_MODIFY
[*]
@team1 = permission_level_1
@team2 = permission_level_2
@team3 = permission_level_2, TICKET_CREATE
}}}

=== !AuthzSourcePolicy  (mod_authz_svn-like permission policy) #AuthzSourcePolicy

`AuthzSourcePolicy` can be used for restricting access to the repository. Granular permission control needs a definition file, which is the one used by Subversion's mod_authz_svn. 
More information about this file format and about its usage in Subversion is available in the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html Path-Based Authorization] section in the Server Configuration chapter of the svn book.

Example:
{{{#!ini
[/]
* = r

[/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

[/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]
harry =
}}}

 * '''/''' = ''Everyone has read access by default''
 * '''/branches/calc/bug-142''' = ''harry has read/write access, sally read only''
 * '''/branches/calc/bug-142/secret''' = ''harry has no access, sally has read access (inherited as a sub folder permission)''

==== Trac Configuration

To activate granular permissions you __must__ specify the {{{authz_file}}} option in the `[svn]` section of trac.ini. If this option is set to null or not specified, the permissions will not be used.

{{{#!ini
[svn]
authz_file = /path/to/svnaccessfile
}}}

If you want to support the use of the `[`''modulename''`:/`''some''`/`''path''`]` syntax within the `authz_file`, add:

{{{#!ini
authz_module_name = modulename
}}}

where ''modulename'' refers to the same repository indicated by the `<name>.dir` entry in the `[repositories]` section. As an example, if the `somemodule.dir` entry in the `[repositories]` section is `/srv/active/svn/somemodule`, that would yield the following:

{{{ #!ini
[svn]
authz_file = /path/to/svnaccessfile
authz_module_name = somemodule
...
[repositories]
somemodule.dir = /srv/active/svn/somemodule 
}}}

where the svn access file, {{{/path/to/svnaccessfile}}}, contains entries such as {{{[somemodule:/some/path]}}}.

'''Note:''' Usernames inside the Authz file __must__ be the same as those used inside trac. 

As of version 0.12, make sure you have ''!AuthzSourcePolicy'' included in the permission_policies list in trac.ini, otherwise the authz permissions file will be ignored.

{{{#!ini
[trac]
permission_policies = AuthzSourcePolicy, ReadonlyWikiPolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy
}}}

==== Subversion Configuration

The same access file is typically applied to the corresponding Subversion repository using an Apache directive like this:
{{{#!apache
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/svnaccessfile
</Location>
}}}

For information about how to restrict access to entire projects in a multiple project environment see [trac:wiki:TracMultipleProjectsSVNAccess].

=== ReadonlyWikiPolicy

Since 1.1.2, the read-only attribute of wiki pages is enabled and enforced when `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` is in the list of active permission policies. The default for new Trac installations in 1.1.2 and later is:
{{{
[trac]
permission_policies = ReadonlyWikiPolicy,
 DefaultPermissionPolicy,
 LegacyAttachmentPolicy
}}}

When upgrading from earlier versions of Trac, `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` will be appended to the list of `permission_policies` when upgrading the environment, provided that `permission_policies` has the default value. If any non-default `permission_polices` are active, `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` **will need to be manually added** to the list. A message will be echoed to the console when upgrading the environment, indicating if any action needs to be taken.

**!ReadonlyWikiPolicy must be listed //before// !DefaultPermissionPolicy**. The latter returns `True` to allow modify, delete or rename actions when the user has the respective `WIKI_*` permission, without consideration for the read-only attribute.

The `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` returns `False` to deny modify, delete and rename actions on wiki pages when the page has the read-only attribute set and the user does not have `WIKI_ADMIN`, regardless of `WIKI_MODIFY`, `WIKI_DELETE` and `WIKI_RENAME` permissions. It returns `None` for all other cases.

When active, the [#AuthzPolicy] should therefore come before `ReadonlyWikiPolicy`, allowing it to grant or deny the actions on individual resources, which is the usual ordering for `AuthzPolicy` in the `permission_policies` list.
{{{
[trac]
permission_policies = AuthzPolicy,
 ReadonlyWikiPolicy,
 DefaultPermissionPolicy,
 LegacyAttachmentPolicy
}}}

The placement of [#AuthzSourcePolicy] relative to `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` does not matter since they don't perform checks on the same realms.

For all other permission policies, the user will need to decide the proper ordering. Generally, if the permission policy should be capable of overriding the check performed by `ReadonlyWikiPolicy`, it should come before `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` in the list. If the `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` should override the check performed by another permission policy, as is the case for `DefaultPermissionPolicy`, then `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` should come first.

== Debugging permissions
In trac.ini set:
{{{#!ini
[logging]
log_file = trac.log
log_level = DEBUG
log_type = file
}}}

Display the trac.log to understand what checks are being performed:
{{{#!sh
tail -n 0 -f log/trac.log | egrep '\[perm\]|\[authz_policy\]'
}}}

See the sourced documentation of the plugin for more info.
