= Using Search =

Trac has a built-in search engine to allow finding occurrences of keywords and substrings in wiki pages, tickets and changeset properties (author, revision and log message).

Using the Trac search facility is straightforward and its interface should be familiar to most users.

Apart from the [search: Search module], you will also find a small search field above the navigation bar at all time. It provides convenient access to the search module from all pages.

The search results show the most recent modifications ranked first in the results rather than the most relevant result.

== "Quickjump" searches ==
For quick access to various project resources, the quick-search field at the top of every page can be used to enter a [TracLinks wiki link], which will take you directly to the resource identified by that link.

For example:

 * ![42] -- Opens change set 42
 * !#42 -- Opens ticket number 42
 * !{1} -- Opens report 1
 * /trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory

== Advanced ==

=== Disabling Quickjumps ===
To disable the quickjump feature for a search keyword - for example when searching for occurences of the literal word !TracGuide - begin the query with an exclamation mark (`!`).

=== Search Links ===
From the Wiki, it is possible to link to a specific search, using
`search:` links:
 * `search:?q=crash` will search for the string "crash" 
 * `search:?q=trac+link&wiki=on` will search for "trac" and "link" 
   in wiki pages only
