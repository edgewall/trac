= Using Search

Trac has built-in search functionality to search for occurrences of keywords and substrings in wiki pages, tickets and changeset properties, such as author, revision and log messages.

In addition to the [search: Search module], you will also find a small search field above the navigation bar. It provides convenient access to the search module from all pages.

The search results show the most recent modifications ranked first.

== Quick searches

For quick access to project resources, the quick-search field at the top of every page can be used to enter a [TracLinks TracLink], which will take you directly to the resource identified by that link:

 * ![42] -- Opens change set 42
 * !#42 -- Opens ticket number 42
 * !{1} -- Opens report 1
 * /trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory in the default repository
 * /repos1/trunk -- Opens the browser for the `trunk` directory in the `repos1` repository

To disable the Quickjump feature for a keyword start the query with an exclamation mark (`!`): use `!TracGuide` to search for occurrences of the literal word !TracGuide.

== Search TracLinks

From the Wiki, it is possible to link to a specific search using `search:` links:
 * `search:?q=crash` will search for the string "crash" 
 * `search:?q=trac+link&wiki=on` will search for "trac" and "link" in wiki pages only

== Search Filters

On the search page, pressing the modifier key while selecting a search filter will unselect all other search filters.
