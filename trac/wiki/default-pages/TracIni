= The Trac Configuration File =
[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac configuration is done by editing the '''`trac.ini`''' config file, located in `<projectenv>/conf/trac.ini`.  Changes to the configuration are usually reflected immediately, though changes to the `[components]` or `[logging]` sections will require restarting the web server. You may also need to restart the web server after creating a global configuration file when none was previously present.

== Global Configuration ==

In previous versions, the global configuration was by default located in `$prefix/share/trac/conf/trac.ini` or sometimes /etc/trac/trac.ini depending on the distribution. If you're upgrading, you may want to specify that file to inherit from.

Global options will be merged with the environment-specific options, where local options override global options. The options file is specified as follows:
{{{
[inherit]
file = /usr/share/trac/conf/trac.ini
}}}

== Reference ==

This is a brief reference of available configuration options.

[[TracIni]]

== [components] == #components-section
This section is used to enable or disable components provided by plugins, as well as by Trac itself. The component to enable/disable is specified via the name of the option. Whether its enabled is determined by the option value; setting the value to `enabled` or `on` will enable the component, any other value (typically `disabled` or `off`) will disable the component.

The option name is either the fully qualified name of the components or the module/package prefix of the component. The former enables/disables a specific component, while the latter enables/disables any component in the specified package/module.

Consider the following configuration snippet:
{{{
[components]
trac.ticket.report.ReportModule = disabled
webadmin.* = enabled
}}}

The first option tells Trac to disable the [wiki:TracReports report module]. The second option instructs Trac to enable all components in the `webadmin` package. Note that the trailing wildcard is required for module/package matching.

See the ''Plugins'' page on ''About Trac'' to get the list of active components (requires `CONFIG_VIEW` [wiki:TracPermissions permissions].)

== [ticket-custom] == #ticket-custom-section

In this section, you can define additional fields for tickets. See TracTicketsCustomFields for more details.

== [ticket-workflow] == #ticket-workflow-section
''(since 0.11)''

The workflow for tickets is controlled by plugins. 
By default, there's only a `ConfigurableTicketWorkflow` component in charge. 
That component allows the workflow to be configured via this section in the trac.ini file.
See TracWorkflow for more details.

== [milestone-groups] == #milestone-groups-section
''(since 0.11)''

As the workflow for tickets is now configurable, there can be many ticket states,
and simply displaying closed tickets vs. all the others is maybe not appropriate 
in all cases. This section enables one to easily create ''groups'' of states 
that will be shown in different colors in the milestone progress bar.

Example configuration (which is also the default):
{{{
closed = closed
closed.order = 0                     # sequence number in the progress bar
closed.query_args = group=resolution # optional extra param for the query
closed.overall_completion = true     # count for overall completion

active = *                           # one catch-all group is allowed
active.order = 1
active.css_class = open              # CSS class for this interval
}}}

The definition consists in a comma-separated list of accepted status.
Also, '*' means any status and could be used to associate all remaining
states to one catch-all group.

The CSS class can be one of: new (yellow), open (no color) or
closed (green). New styles can easily be added using the following
selector:  `table.progress td.<class>`

== [svn:externals] == #svn:externals-section
''(since 0.11)''

The TracBrowser for Subversion can interpret the `svn:externals` property of folders out of the box.
However, if those externals are ''not'' using the `http:` protocol, or if a link to a different repository browser (such another Trac or [http://www.viewvc.org/ ViewVC]) is desired, then Trac needs to be able to map an external prefix to this other URL.

This mapping is done in the `[svn:externals]` section of the TracIni

Example:
{{{
[svn:externals]
http://theirserver.org/svn/eng-soft       http://ourserver/viewvc/svn/$path/?pathrev=25914
svn://anotherserver.com/tools_repository  http://ourserver/trac/support/browser/$path?rev=$rev
}}}
With the above, the `svn://anotherserver.com/tools_repository/tags/1.1/tools` external will be mapped to `http://ourserver/trac/support/browser/tags/1.1/tools?rev=` (and `rev` will be set to the appropriate revision number if the external additionally specifies a revision, see the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.externals.html SVN Book on externals] for more details).
