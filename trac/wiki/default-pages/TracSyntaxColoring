= Syntax Coloring of Source Code =
Trac supports language-specific syntax highlighting of source code in [wiki:WikiFormatting wiki formatted] text and the [wiki:TracBrowser repository browser].

To do this, Trac uses external libraries with support for a great number of programming languages.

Currently Trac supports syntax coloring using one or more of the following packages:

 * [http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/ GNU Enscript] 
 * [http://silvercity.sourceforge.net/ SilverCity]

To activate syntax coloring, simply install either one (or more) of these packages. No additional configuration is required, however to modify the colors, have a look at `trac/htdocs/css/code.css`.

When in use, Trac will automatically prioritize !SilverCity highlighting over Enscript if possible, (see note below). 

If neither package is available, Trac will display the data as plain text. 

'''Note:''' Enscript supports a greater number of languages, however !SilverCity is generally faster since it is a library and isn't executed in an external process.

=== About SilverCity ===
!SilverCity uses the lexer from [http://www.scintilla.org/ Scintilla]. Scintilla supports more languages than !SilverCity implements. If you want to add a language to !SilverCity supported by Scintilla, it's not very difficult. See [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/SilverCityAddLanguage SilverCityAddLanguage] for some information how.
