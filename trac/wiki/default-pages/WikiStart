= Welcome to Trac 1.0.15

Trac is a '''minimalistic''' approach to '''web-based''' management of
'''software projects'''. Its goal is to simplify effective tracking and handling of software issues, enhancements and overall progress.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with the single goal to
'''help developers write great software''' while '''staying out of the way'''
and imposing as little as possible on a team's established process and
culture.

"[wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] ''yourenvdir'' initenv" created
a new Trac environment, containing a default set of wiki pages and some sample
data. This newly created environment also contains
[wiki:TracGuide documentation] to help you get started with your project.

You can use [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] to configure
[http://trac.edgewall.org/ Trac] to better fit your project, especially in
regard to ''components'', ''versions'' and ''milestones''.


TracGuide is a good place to start.
