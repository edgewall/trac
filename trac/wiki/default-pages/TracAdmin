Trac is distributed with a powerful command-line configuration tool. This tool can be used  to configure and customize your Trac-installation to better fit your needs.

Some of those operations can also be performed via the web interface thanks to the optional [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WebAdmin WebAdmin] plugin, distributed separately for now.

== Usage ==

You can get a comprehensive list of the available options, commands and sub-commands by invoking `trac-admin` with the `help` command:
{{{
trac-admin help
}}}

Unless you're executing the `help`, `about` or `version` sub-commands, you'll need to specify the path to the TracEnvironment that you want to administer as the first argument, for example:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki list
}}}

== Interactive Mode ==

When passing the environment path as the only argument, `trac-admin` starts in interactive mode.
Commands can then be executed on the selected environment using the prompt, which offers tab-completion
(on non-Windows environments, and when the Python `readline` module is available) and automatic repetition of the last command issued.

Once you're in interactive mode, you can also get help on specific commands or subsets of commands:

For example, to get an explanation of the `resync` command, run:
{{{
> help resync
}}}

To get help on a all the Wiki-related commands, run:
{{{
> help wiki
}}}
