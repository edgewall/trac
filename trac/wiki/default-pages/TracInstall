[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac is written in the Python programming language and needs a database, [http://sqlite.org/ SQLite], [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL], or [http://mysql.com/ MySQL]. For HTML rendering, Trac uses the [http://genshi.edgewall.org Genshi] templating system.

Since 0.12, Trac can also be localized, and there's probably a translation available for your language. If this is what you want, then make sure you have installed the optional package [#OtherPythonUtilities Babel]. Trac can still be installed without Babel, but then you will only get the english version, as usual.
If you're interested in contributing new translations for other languages or enhance the existing translations, then please have a look at ["TracL10N"].

What follows are generic instructions for installing and setting up Trac and its requirements. While you can find instructions for installing Trac on specific systems at TracInstallPlatforms on the main Trac site, please be sure to '''first read through these general instructions''' to get a good understanding of the tasks involved.

== Short - Install a released version ==
For the quick install, make sure you have [http://python.org Python-2.5], [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install easy_install] and SQlite-3.3.4 installed (or above).
{{{
sudo easy_install http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/trunk
}}}

== Requirements - also older versions possible ==

To install Trac, the following software packages must be installed:

 * [http://www.python.org/ Python], version >= 2.3
   * if using mod_python together with xml-related things, use python-2.5. expat is namespaced there and does not cause apache to crash any more(see [http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/ModPython/Articles/ExpatCausingApacheCrash here] for details).
   * For RPM-based systems you might also need the `python-devel` and `python-xml` packages.
   * See instructions in ["TracOnWindows/Python2.5"]
 * [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools setuptools], version >= 0.6
 * [http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Download Genshi], version >= 0.4.1
 * You also need a database system and the corresponding python drivers for it.
   The database can be either SQLite, PostgreSQL or ''MySQL (experimental)''.

=== For SQLite ===

 * [http://www.sqlite.org/ SQLite], version 3.3.4 and above preferred.
 * If not using Python-2.5: [http://pysqlite.org/ PySQLite], version 1.x (for SQLite 2.x) or version 2.x (for SQLite 3.x), version 2.3.2 preferred. For details see PySqlite

''Note: It appears that PySQLite 2.x is required if you plan to use the 'trac-post-commit-hook.py' script available from the 'contrib' section of the source repository.''

''Note: Users of Mac OS X please take care; the Apple-supplied SQLite contains additional code to support file locking on network filesystems like AFP or SMB. This is not presently (3.3.6) in the mainline sources, so if you build your own SQLite from source it will not function correctly on such filesystems - typically it gives the error "{{{database is locked}}}". [http://www.alastairs-place.net/2006/07/sqlite_and_mac/ A patch] is available for version 3.3.6, based on Apple's code, otherwise you're probably best off using the Apple supplied version (presently 3.1.3).''

=== For PostgreSQL ===

 * [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL]
 * [http://initd.org/projects/psycopg2 psycopg2] or [http://pypgsql.sourceforge.net/ pyPgSQL]

'''Warning''': PostgreSQL 8.3 uses a strict type checking mechanism. To use Trac with the 8.3 Version of PostgreSQL, you will need [http://trac.edgewall.org/changeset/6512 trac-0.11] or later.

=== For MySQL ===

'''Warning''': MySQL support is currently ''still'' experimental. That means it works for some people, but several issues remain, in particular regarding the use of unicode and the key length in the repository cache. See MySqlDb for more detailed information.

 * [http://mysql.com/ MySQL], version 4.1 or later
 * [http://sf.net/projects/mysql-python MySQLdb], version 1.2.2 or later

=== Optional Requirements ===

==== Version Control System ====

'''Please note:''' if using Subversion, Trac must be installed on the '''same machine'''. Remote repositories are currently not supported.

 * [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion], version >= 1.0. (versions recommended: 1.2.4, 1.3.2 or 1.4.2) and the '''''corresponding''''' Python bindings. For troubleshooting, check TracSubversion
   * Trac uses the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook-1.1/ch08s02.html#svn-ch-8-sect-2.3 SWIG] bindings included in the Subversion distribution, '''not''' [http://pysvn.tigris.org/ PySVN] (which is sometimes confused with the standard SWIG bindings).
   * If Subversion was already installed without the SWIG bindings, on Unix you'll need to re-`configure` Subversion and `make swig-py`, `make install-swig-py`.
   * There are [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 pre-compiled bindings] available for win32. 
 * Support for other version control systems is provided via third-parties. See PluginList and VersioningSystemBackend.

==== Web Server ====
 * A CGI-capable web server (see TracCgi), or
 * a [http://fastcgi.com/ FastCGI]-capable web server (see TracFastCgi), or
 * [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] with [http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/ mod_wsgi] (see [wiki:TracModWSGI])
    * This should work with Apache 1.3, 2.0 or 2.2 and promises to deliver more performance than using mod_python. A little less mature than mod_python.
 * [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] with [http://modpython.org/ mod_python 3.1.3+] (see TracModPython)
    * When installing mod_python the development versions of Python and Apache are required (actually the libraries and header files)

For those stuck with Apache 1.3, it is also possible to get Trac working with [http://modpython.org/ mod_python 2.7] (see [wiki:TracModPython2.7 TracModPython2.7]). This guide hasn't been updated since 0.84, so it may or may not work.

==== Other Python Utilities ====
 * [http://babel.edgewall.org Babel], version >= 0.9.2 for localization support
 * [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ docutils], version >= 0.3.9 for WikiRestructuredText.
 * [http://pygments.pocoo.org Pygments] for [wiki:TracSyntaxColoring syntax highlighting], also [http://silvercity.sourceforge.net/ SilverCity] and/or [http://gnu.org/software/enscript/enscript.html Enscript] may still be used.
    * Note that !SilverCity 0.9.6 has a [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1424436&group_id=45693&atid=443739 bug] that breaks Python syntax highlighting in Trac. Until an update is made available, we recommend using version 0.9.5.
 * [http://pytz.sf.net pytz] to get a complete list of time zones, otherwise Trac will fall back on a shorter list from an internal time zone implementation.

'''Attention''': The various available versions of these dependencies are not necessarily interchangable, so please pay attention to the version numbers above. If you are having trouble getting Trac to work please double-check all the dependencies before asking for help on the MailingList or IrcChannel.

Please refer to the documentation of these packages to find out how they are best installed. In addition, most of the [wiki:TracInstallPlatforms platform-specific instructions] also describe the installation of the dependencies. Keep in mind however that the information there ''probably concern older versions of Trac than the one you're installing''.

== Installing Trac ==

One way to install Trac is using `setuptools`.
With setuptools you can install Trac from the subversion repository; for example,
to install release version 0.12dev do:
{{{
easy_install http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/trunk
}}}

But of course the python-typical setup at the top of the source directory also works:
{{{
$ python ./setup.py install
}}}
See SubversionRepository for details about getting the source.

''Note 1: you'll need root permissions or equivalent for this step.'' [[br]]
''Note 2: installing from source is the preferred method if you want to have a localized version of Trac'' [[br]]

This will byte-compile the python source code and install it as an .egg file or folder in the `site-packages` directory
of your Python installation. The .egg will also contain all other resources needed by standard Trac, such as htdocs and templates.

The script will also install the [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] command-line tool, used to create and maintain [wiki:TracEnvironment project environments], as well as the [wiki:TracStandalone tracd] standalone server.

If you want to make Trac available in other languages, make sure you have installed Babel and then run this additional step before doing the `install` (or simply redo the `install` afterwards):
{{{
$ python ./setup.py compile_catalog -f
}}}
(the `-f` flag is needed as long as some translations are marked ''fuzzy'', i.e. incomplete, which will most probably be the case during the whole development period, as  strings are continuously added or modified)

=== Advanced Options ===

To install Trac to a custom location, or find out about other advanced installation options, run:
{{{
easy_install --help
}}}

Also see [http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html Installing Python Modules] for detailed information.

Specifically, you might be interested in:
{{{
easy_install --prefix=/path/to/installdir
}}}
or, if installing Trac to a Mac OS X system:
{{{
easy_install --prefix=/usr/local --install-dir=/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages
}}}

The above will place your `tracd` and `trac-admin` commands into `/usr/local/bin` and will install the Trac libraries and dependencies into `/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages`, which is Apple's preferred location for third-party Python application installations.

== Creating a Project Environment ==

A [wiki:TracEnvironment Trac environment] is the backend storage where Trac stores information like wiki pages, tickets, reports, settings, etc. An environment is basically a directory that contains a human-readable configuration file and various other files and directories.

A new environment is created using [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin]:
{{{
$ trac-admin /path/to/myproject initenv
}}}

[wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] will prompt you for the information it needs to create the environment, such as the name of the project, the type and the path to an existing [wiki:TracEnvironment#SourceCodeRepository source code repository], the [wiki:TracEnvironment#DatabaseConnectionStrings database connection string], and so on. If you're not sure what to specify for one of these options, just leave it blank to use the default value. The database connection string in particular will always work as long as you have SQLite installed. Leaving the path to the source code repository empty will disable any functionality related to version control, but you can always add that back when the basic system is running.

Also note that the values you specify here can be changed later by directly editing the [wiki:TracIni] configuration file.

''Note: The user account under which the web server runs will require write permissions to the environment directory and all the files inside.  On Linux, with the web server running as user apache and group apache, enter:''

  chown -R apache.apache /path/to/myproject


== Running the Standalone Server ==

After having created a Trac environment, you can easily try the web interface by running the standalone server [wiki:TracStandalone tracd]:
{{{
$ tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject
}}}

Then, fire up a browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/`. You should get a simple listing of all environments that tracd knows about. Follow the link to the environment you just created, and you should see Trac in action. If you only plan on managing a single project with trac you can have the standalone server skip the environment list by starting it like this:
{{{
$ tracd -s --port 8000 /path/to/myproject
}}}


== Running Trac on a Web Server ==

Trac provides three options for connecting to a "real" web server: [wiki:TracCgi CGI], [wiki:TracFastCgi FastCGI] and [wiki:TracModPython mod_python]. For decent performance, it is recommended that you use either FastCGI or mod_python.

If you're not afraid of running development code, you can also try running Trac on [wiki:TracModWSGI mod_wsgi]. This should deliver even better performance than mod_python, but the module is not considered stable just yet.

== Configuring Authentication ==

The process of adding, removing, and configuring user accounts for authentication depends on the specific way you run Trac. The basic procedure is described in the [wiki:TracCgi#AddingAuthentication "Adding Authentication"] section on the TracCgi page. To learn how to setup authentication for the frontend you're using, please refer to one of the following pages:

 * TracStandalone if you use the standalone server, `tracd`.
 * TracCgi if you use the CGI or FastCGI methods.
 * TracModPython if you use the mod_python method.

== Trac 0.11 & SVN on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) ==

 * TracOnLeopardServer

== Using Trac ==

Once you have your Trac site up and running, you should be able to browse your subversion repository, create tickets, view the timeline, etc.

Keep in mind that anonymous (not logged in) users can by default access most but not all of the features. You will need to configure authentication and grant additional [wiki:TracPermissions permissions] to authenticated users to see the full set of features.
