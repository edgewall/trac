## Macros and constants

{# Usage:

     # import "jmacros.html" as jmacros with context

   Note that this import is not necessary in templates that extend the
   "jlayout.html" template, as the latter contains that import.
   However, in secondary templates included from a template extending
   "jlayout.html", jmacros is no longer accessible and the import
   statement has to be written again.

#}


{# Creates an <input> form field containing the CSRF protection token.

   All form with method POST should include this field.

   Example:

     <form id="query" method="post" action="${href.query()}">
     ${jmacros.form_token_input()}
     ...
     </form>
#}
# macro form_token_input()
<input type="hidden" name="__FORM_TOKEN" value="${form_token}" />
# endmacro
## jinjacheck: "input" OK
