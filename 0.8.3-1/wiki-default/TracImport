}}}

Currently, the following data is imported from Bugzilla:

  * bugs
  * bug activity (field changes)
  * bug attachments

The script provides a number of features to ease the conversion, such as:

  * PRODUCT_KEYWORDS:  Trac doesn't have the concept of products, so the script provides the ability to attach a ticket keyword instead.

  * IGNORE_COMMENTS:  Don't import Bugzilla comments that match a certain regexp.

  * STATUS_KEYWORDS:  Attach ticket keywords for the Bugzilla statuses not available in Trac.  By default, the 'VERIFIED' and 'RELEASED' Bugzilla statuses are translated into Trac keywords.

For more details on the available options, see the configuration section at the top of the script.

== Sourceforge ==

Ticket data can be imported from Sourceforge using the sourceforge2trac.py script, available in the contrib/ directory of the Trac distribution.
