= Custom Ticket Fields =
Trac supports adding custom, user-defined fields to the ticket module. Using custom fields, you can add typed, site-specific properties to tickets.

== Configuration ==
Configuring custom ticket fields is done in the [wiki:TracIni trac.ini] file. All field definitions should be under a section named `[ticket-custom]`.

The syntax of each field definition is:
{{{
 FIELD_NAME = TYPE
 (FIELD_NAME.OPTION = VALUE)
 ...
}}}
The example below should help to explain the syntax.

=== Available Field Types and Options ===
 * '''text''': A simple (one line) text field.
   * label: Descriptive label.
   * value: Default value.
   * order: Sort order placement. (Determines relative placement in forms.)
 * '''checkbox''': A boolean value check box.
   * label: Descriptive label.
   * value: Default value (0 or 1).
   * order: Sort order placement.
 * '''select''': Drop-down select box. Uses a list of values.
   * label: Descriptive label.
   * options: List of values, separated by '''|''' (vertical pipe).
   * value: Default value (Item #, starting at 0).
   * order: Sort order placement.
 * '''radio''': Radio buttons. Essentially the same as '''select'''.
   * label: Descriptive label.
   * options: List of values, separated by '''|''' (vertical pipe).
   * value: Default value (Item #, starting at 0).
   * order: Sort order placement.
 * '''textarea''': Multi-line text area.
   * label: Descriptive label.
   * value: Default text.
   * cols: Width in columns.
   * rows: Height in lines.
   * order: Sort order placement.

=== Sample Config ===
{{{
[ticket-custom]

test_one = text
test_one.label = Just a text box

test_two = text
test_two.label = Another text-box
test_two.value = Just a default value

test_three = checkbox
test_three.label = Some checkbox
test_three.value = 1

test_four = select
test_four.label = My selectbox
test_four.options = one|two|third option|four
test_four.value = 2

test_five = radio
test_five.label = Radio buttons are fun
test_five.options = uno|dos|tres|cuatro|cinco
test_five.value = 1

test_six = textarea
test_six.label = This is a large textarea
test_six.value = Default text
test_six.cols = 60
test_six.rows = 30
}}}

''Note: To make entering an option for a `select` type field optional, specify a leading `|` in the `fieldname.options` option.''

=== Reports Involving Custom Fields ===

The SQL required for TracReports to include custom ticket fields is relatively hard to get right. You need a `JOIN` with the `ticket_custom` field for every custom field that should be involved.

The following example includes a custom ticket field named `progress` in the report:
{{{
#!sql
SELECT p.value AS __color__,
   id AS ticket, summary, component, version, milestone, severity,
   (CASE status WHEN 'assigned' THEN owner||' *' ELSE owner END) AS owner,
   time AS created,
   changetime AS _changetime, description AS _description,
   reporter AS _reporter,
  (CASE WHEN c.value = '0' THEN 'None' ELSE c.value END) AS progress
  FROM ticket t
     LEFT OUTER JOIN ticket_custom c ON (t.id = c.ticket AND c.name = 'progress')
     JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type='priority'
  WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened')
  ORDER BY p.value, milestone, severity, time
}}}

Note in particular the `LEFT OUTER JOIN` statement here.
