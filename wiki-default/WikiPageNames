Wiki page names are written using CamelCase. Within a wiki text, any word in CamelCase automatically becomes a hyperlink to the wiki page with that same name.

Page names must follow these rules:

 1. The name must consist of alphabetic characters only. No digits, spaces, punctuation, or underscores are allowed.
 1. A name must have at least two capital letters.
 1. The first character must be capitalized.
 1. Every capital letter must be followed by one or more lower-case letters. 
 1. The use of slash ( / ) is permitted to create a hierarchy inside the wiki.

If you want a to create a wiki page that doesnt follow CamelCase rules you could use the following syntax see #614:
{{{
[wiki:NOTCamelCase NOTCamelCase]
}}}
