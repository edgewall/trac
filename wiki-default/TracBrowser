= The Trac Browser =
[[TracGuideToc]]

The Trac browser can be used to browse directories, change logs 
and specific revisions of files stored in a subversion repository.

Directory entries are displayed in a list with sortable columns. The list 
entries can be sorted by ''name'', ''size'' or ''age'' by clicking on the column
headers. The sort order can be reversed by clicking on a given column
header again.

The browser can be used to navigate through the directory structure 
by clicking on the directory names. Clicking on a file name will show
the contents of the file. Clicking on the revision number of a file or
directory will take you to the revision history for that file.

It's also possible to browse directories or files as they were in history,
at any given repository revision. The default behavior is to display the
latest revision but another revision number can easily be selected using
the ''View revision'' input field at the top of the page.

== RSS Support ==

The browser module provided RSS feeds to monitor changes to a file or
directory. To subscribe to an RSS feed for a file or directory, open its
revision log in the browser and click the orange 'XML' icon at the bottom
of the page. For more information on RSS support in Trac, see TracRss.
