= Trac Links =
As you might have guessed, TracLinks are a very fundamental feature of Trac.

They allow hyperlinking between Trac entities (tickets, reports, changesets, Wiki
pages, milestones and source files) from anywhere WikiFormatting is used.

TracLinks are generally of the form '''type:id''' (where ''id'' represents the
number, name or path of the item) though some frequently used kinds of items
also have short-hand notations.

Some examples:

 * Tickets: '''!#1''' or '''!ticket:1'''
 * Reports: '''!{1}''' or '''!report:1'''
 * Changesets: '''![1]''' or '''!changeset:1'''
 * Wiki pages: '''CamelCase''' or '''!wiki:CamelCase'''
 * Milestones: '''!milestone:1.0'''
 * Files: '''!source:trunk/COPYING'''

Display:
 * Tickets: #1 or ticket:1
 * Reports: {1} or report:1
 * Changesets: [1] or changeset:1
 * Wiki pages: CamelCase or wiki:CamelCase
 * Milestones: milestone:1.0
 * Files: source:trunk/COPYING

'''Note:''' The wiki:CamelCase form is rarely used, but it can be convenient to refer to
pages whose names do not follow WikiPageNames rules, i.e., single words,
non-alphabetic characters, etc.

Trac links using the full (non-shorthand) notation can also be given a custom
link title like this:

{{{
[ticket:1 This is a link to ticket number one].
}}}

Display: [ticket:1 This is a link to ticket number one].

If the title is be omitted, only the id (the part after the colon) is displayed:

{{{
[ticket:1]
}}}

Display: [ticket:1]

It might seem a simple enough concept at a glance, but actually allows quite a complex network of information. In practice, it's very intuitive and simple to use, and we've found the "link trail" extremely helpful to better understand what's happening in a project or why a particular change was made.

== source: links ==
The default behavior for a source:/some/path link is to open the directory browser if the path points
to a directory and otherwise open the log view. It's also possible to link directly to a specific
revision of a file like this: source:/some/file#123 or like this to link to the latest revision:
source:/some/file#latest.

== Where to use TracLinks ==
You can use TracLinks in:

 * Source code (Subversion) commit messages
 * Wiki pages
 * Full descriptions for tickets, reports and milestones

and any other text fields explicitly marked as supporting WikiFormatting.

== Escaping Links ==

To prevent parsing of a !TracLink, you can escape it by preceding it with a '!' (exclamation mark).
{{{
 !NoLinkHere.
 ![42] is not a link either.
}}}

Display:
 !NoLinkHere.
 ![42] is not a link either.
