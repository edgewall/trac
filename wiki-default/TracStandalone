= Tracd =

Tracd is a lightweight standalone Trac web server. In most cases it's easier to setup and runs faster than the [wiki:TracCgi CGI script].

== Pros ==

 * Fewer dependencies: You don't need to install apache or any other web-server.
 * Fast: Should be as fast as the [wiki:TracModPython mod_python] version (and much faster than the [wiki:TracCgi CGI]).

== Cons ==

 * Less features: Tracd implements a very simple web-server and is not as configurable as Apache HTTPD.
 * No native HTTPS support: [http://www.rickk.com/sslwrap/ sslwrap] can be used instead,
   or [http://lists.edgewall.com/archive/trac/2005-August/004381.html STUNNEL].

== Usage examples ==

A single project on port 8080. (http://localhost:8080/)
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 /path/to/project
}}}
With more than one project. (http://localhost:8080/project1/ and http://localhost:8080/project2/)
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2
}}}

You can't have the last portion of the path identical between the projects since that's how trac keeps the URLs of the
different projects unique. So if you use /project1/path/to and /project2/path/to, you will only see the second project.

== Using Authentication ==

Tracd provides support for both Basic and Digest authentication. The default is to use Digest; to use Basic authentication, replace `--auth` with `--basic-auth` in the examples below, and omit the realm.

If the file `/path/to/users.htdigest` contain user accounts for project1 with the realm "mycompany.com", you'd use the following command-line to start tracd:
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 --auth project1,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com /path/to/project1
}}}
''Note that the project “name” passed to the `--auth` option is actually the base name of the project environment directory.""

Of course, the digest file can be be shared so that it is used for more than one project:
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 \
   --auth project1,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com \
   --auth project2,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com \
   /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2
}}}

== Generating Passwords Without Apache ==

If you don't have Apache available, you can use this simple Python script to generate your passwords:

{{{
from optparse import OptionParser
import md5

# build the options
usage = "usage: %prog [options]"
parser = OptionParser(usage=usage)
parser.add_option("-u", "--username",action="store", dest="username", type = "string",
                  help="the username for whom to generate a password")
parser.add_option("-p", "--password",action="store", dest="password", type = "string",
                  help="the password to use")
(options, args) = parser.parse_args()

# check options
if (options.username is None) or (options.password is None):
   parser.error("You must supply both the username and password")
   
# Generate the string to enter into the htdigest file
realm = 'trac'
kd = lambda x: md5.md5(':'.join(x)).hexdigest()
print ':'.join((options.username, realm, kd([options.username, realm, options.password])))
}}}
