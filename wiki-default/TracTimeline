= The Trac Timeline =
[[TracGuideToc]]

The timeline provides a historic view of the project in a single report.

It lists all Trac events that have occured in chronological order, a
brief description of each event and if applicable, the person responsible for
the change.

The timeline lists these kinds of events:
 * '''Wiki page events''' -- Creation and changes
 * '''Ticket events''' -- Creation and resolution/closing (and optionally other changes)
 * '''Source code changes ''' -- Repository check-ins
 * '''Milestone ''' -- Milestone completed

Each event entry provides a hyperlink to the specific event in question, as well as
a brief excerpt of the actual comment or text, if available.

See [wiki:TracIni#timeline TracIni] for timeline configuration options.
